This assignment's main goal is to build a blended image from input images using Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids 
and reconstruction algorithms. In my report, you can find a full explanation of each 
Gaussian and Laplacian pyramid that I developed, as well as the implementation of each 
step and some of the related codes, and also the six final results and their signal and frequency plots of 
blended outputs. Here is a link to my Google Drive for the 12 input and 6 output files and the mask outputs that 
I used and generated throughout this assignment:
