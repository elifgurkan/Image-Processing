The goal of this assignment is to take a color image as input and produce a cartoon like version of the input image as output.In this assignment, I worked in Google Colab environment to implement my filtering algorithms. I chose that platform, because in Google Colab or in Jupyter Notebook, it is allowed us to see the instant output of the code blocks that I wrote. In the assignments like this, I think it is better to use them instead of PyCharm or Anaconda. I uploaded 17 images with the .jpg extension  to test the filtering algorithms. I mostly chose images which are neither too bright nor too dark. I was careful not to choose images with too much sky or empty space. In this way, I did not have any problems with the images when applying my Lab and edge detection algorithms.While implementing my code, I worked in parts and after getting good results, I continued so that if there was a problem in the last step, I would not waste time trying to understand where the problem was. In this respect, as I said, I found it very beneficial to use Google Colab. As a result of the filtering and editing I did, I was able to obtain the desired results, as can be seen from the images I mentioned and added in my report.You can find detailed explanations of these in my report.
